# Using the R Risk Score Script

## Overview

This repository contains an R script converted from a Jupyter Notebook. The script is designed to calculate risk scores based on provided datasets and includes necessary preprocessing, analysis, and visualization steps.

## Prerequisites

To run the R script successfully, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

R (version 4.0 or later recommended)

RStudio (optional, but recommended for better usability)

Required R packages (install if not already available):

install.packages(c("tidyverse", "data.table", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "readr"))

## Data Structure

The input dataset should be formatted as a CSV file with the following structure:

ID: Unique identifier for each record.

Time (Follow-up Duration): Numeric, representing the duration (e.g., days, months, or years) from baseline to the event or censoring.

Event Status: Binary variable indicating whether the event of interest occurred (1) or if the observation was censored (0).

## Predictor Variables:

Demographic Variables: Age (numeric), Gender (categorical, e.g., "Male", "Female").

Clinical and Laboratory Biomarkers: Includes relevant measurements such as blood markers, imaging features, or any numerical test results.

Comorbidities: Binary or categorical variables indicating the presence of relevant medical conditions.

Treatment or Intervention Variables: If applicable, binary or categorical variables capturing medications or procedures applied before or during follow-up.

Ensure there are no missing values in critical columns (especially Time, Event Status, and key predictive features). Categorical variables should be properly encoded (e.g., one-hot encoding for non-binary categories if required).

## Usage

1. Clone or Download the Repository

You can download the script file R_RiskScore-Marc_script.R and place it in your working directory.

2. Load the Script in R

Open RStudio or a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located:

setwd("/path/to/script")
source("R_RiskScore-Marc_script.R")

3. Provide Input Data

Ensure you have the required input files available. If the script uses CSV files, update the file paths accordingly:

data <- read.csv("data/input_file.csv")

Modify the script to load your dataset if necessary.

4. Run the Analysis

Once the script is sourced, execute the functions and commands within the script to process data and generate risk scores.

result <- calculate_risk_score(data)
print(result)

5. Visualizing Results

If the script includes plots, ensure the necessary plotting functions are run:

plot_risk_distribution(result)

6. Save Output

You can save the output results as CSV or other formats as needed:

write.csv(result, "output/risk_scores.csv", row.names = FALSE)

Troubleshooting

If any package is missing, install it using install.packages("package_name").

Ensure the file paths in the script match the location of your input data.

If using large datasets, consider optimizing memory usage with data.table instead of data.frame.
